## Problem Statement: Caching in REST APIs

* This is a simple Blog writing application where users can create, update, retrieve, and delete blogs. This application has a large number of read operations. At peak times it is observed that retrieving blogs has a high latency. You need to solve the problem by implementing caching.


To solve the problem, you need to complete the following steps:

**Note**: Classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors when the exercise is cloned locally. You need to go through the comments thoroughly and complete the application.

    1. Manage dependencies in pom.xml.
    2. Complete the classes and methods by analyzing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors.
    3. Implement the functionality of the methods, and ensure that all the test cases pass.
    4. Test in Postman the functionalities to add, delete, update, and get all blogs.
